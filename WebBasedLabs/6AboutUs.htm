                    <h2>Why You Should Ski at Vail</h2>
                    <p>
                        Vail isn't just another ski resort—it's a world-renowned alpine paradise. With over 5,300 acres
                        of skiable terrain, Vail offers everything from powdery back bowls to beginner-friendly greens.
                        Whether you're chasing fresh snow, perfect grooming, or a quiet glade run, Vail delivers on
                        every front.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What really sets Vail apart is its combination of luxury and adventure. The village is home to
                        top-tier dining, cozy lodges, and boutique shopping, all nestled at the foot of one of North
                        America's premier ski mountains. And with one of the most modern and efficient lift systems in
                        the world, you’ll spend more time skiing and less time waiting in line.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether you're a first-timer or a lifelong powder hound, skiing at Vail is a bucket-list
                        experience. And with our shop—Birds of Prey Mountain—just down the road, you'll have access to
                        the best gear, expert advice, and a crew that lives and breathes the mountain life.
                    </p>
